/**
 * Represents an Abandoned Ship card in the Galaxy Trucker game.
 *
 * <p>This card presents players with the opportunity to board an abandoned ship
 * in exchange for sacrificing crew members. Players must have sufficient crew
 * to meet the requirement and choose which crew members to sacrifice.</p>
 *
 * <p>The card follows a turn-based approach where players are checked in order
 * to see if they meet the crew requirement. The first player who meets the
 * requirement can choose to accept or decline the opportunity.</p>
 *
 * <p>Card mechanics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Players need a minimum number of crew members (including aliens) to qualify</li>
 * <li>If accepted, the player must sacrifice the required number of crew members</li>
 * <li>In return, the player receives credits and moves backward in time</li>
 * <li>Players with no remaining crew are eliminated from the race</li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p>Note: In case of disconnection, the player automatically refuses the offer.</p>
